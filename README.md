## Source to Red Dog: Superior Firepower

This is the last known source of the Sega Dreamcast game [Red Dog: Superior Firepower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dog:_Superior_Firepower).

It's not known to compile, or work, or indeed represent much other than a historical artifact of how games in the late 90s/early 2000s were created. There is any amount of unused code in this repository, and unfortunately there's no game assets here.

Huge thanks to Jez San who has graciously allowed this code to be open sourced.

### Notes

The Red Dog source is MIT licensed; but parts of the code (e.g. the 3DS Max plugin) contain headers from those packages, and may be licensed differently. Those files have appropriate copyrights in their headers.
