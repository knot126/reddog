SAVIZ! - KNOWN BUGS

1.	Hitting reverse when going forwards causes RD to come to a gradual stop whereas
	letting go of the controls altogether stops RD immediately.

	FIXED

2.	Holding down forward and reverse together does not cause RD to go into the
	supercool strafe mode as required.

	FIXED

3.	Holding down left or right and boosting forwards or backwards when RD is not moving 
	should cause RD to do 'donuts' on the spot and NOT powerslide away as is currently the case.

	FIXED

4.	Button to switch camera collision on and off.

	DONE When camera is too far from player

5.	Try acceleration exponential increase with shoulder button displacement thus giving
	more control when travelling at low speeds.

	FIXED

6.	The player should not be able to rotate RD while it is in the air (all four wheels not
	touching the ground) though they should still be able to move the aiming and shoot.

	FIXED

7.	RD sometimes moves for no reason when stood still on flat ground.

	FIXED
